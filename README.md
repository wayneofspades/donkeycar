# donkeycar: a python self driving library

Donkeycar is minimalist and modular self driving library for Python. It is
developed for hobbyists and students with a focus on allowing fast experimentation and easy
community contributions.

### Possible modifications:
1. TODO: Add ros image stream as a camera option to accomodate a remote visual slam node to consume images from the same stream.
2. TODO: Allow for RGBD image input to behavior cloning model.
3. Maybe: Add GPS PID controller (dependent on adding a GPS and electronic compass)
